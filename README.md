# terminal-game-rust
Just a simple game in the terminal I am working on, specifically to learn Rust, as I have previously been using Java/C.
Code is messy and bad; You probably shouldn't reuse any of it.

Code has been pushed to GitHub, as various different terminals, seem to malfunction when rendering certain unicode characters and colors on the same line.
